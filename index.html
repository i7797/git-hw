                <p>Witches and wizards train to learn how to control their magic. 
                    <br>
                    With young and untrained children, magic will manifest itself subconsciously  <br>
                    in moments of strong emotion: apprehension, fear, anger and sadness.<br>
                    For example, Harry Potter once made his hair grow back after a bad haircut,  <br>
                    set a boa constrictor on his cousin Dudley at the London Zoo, and made Aunt Marge  <br>
                    inflate to an enormous size.While this reaction is usually uncontrollable,<br>
                     as an untrained child, Tom Marvolo Riddle was able to make things move without touching them,
                     <br> make animals do what he wanted without training them, make "bad things happen" 
                     <br>to people who annoyed him, or make them hurt if he wanted to.In addition, Lily Evans
                     <br> was able to guide and control the blooming of a flower simply by wanting it to happen.<br>
                    
                     Almost all magic is done with the use of a wand. On the subject of wandless magic<br>,
                      Rowling says: You can do unfocused and uncontrolled magic without a wand 
                      <br>(for instance when Harry blows up Aunt Marge)  but to do really good spells<br>
                      , yes, you need a wand.A wizard or witch is only at their best when using their own wand.<br>
                       When using another's wand, one's spells are not as strong as they normally would be.
                       <br>Within the books, technical details of magic are obscure.</p>
